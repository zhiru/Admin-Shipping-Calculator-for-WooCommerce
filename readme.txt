With that plugin you can calculate your shipping costs when you create orders in wp-admin.
Select a shipping method and the rate will be calculated for you.

== Description ==

If you create orders for your customers via phone (for example) you go to wp-admin and create a order.
But when you select a shipping method it always show 0 - because there is no calculation.
With this plugin you now see the correct shipping rate for the selected country and for the selected products.
